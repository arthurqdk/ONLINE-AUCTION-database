## ST207 - ASSIGNMENT 1

Feedback and provisional marks

### DATABASE DESIGN

#### A: Conceptual model design (max 20 points)
Overall it is not a good conceptual model. Some entities and relationships are missing in your model. Attributes for each entity are missing in your model as well. You need to use (min, max) notation for cardinality, not the crow's foot notations according to the instructions of the assignment. Please check out our baseline solutions for this miniworld example in github. 


#### B: E-R diagram (max 25 points)
Overall the E-R diagram is ok. You have mapped most of relationship betwen entities correctly. Some entities are missing in your model due to the poor design of the conceptual model in  part (A). Why there are 3 relationship lines between 'members' and 'fallback' in your model? It is confusing that the crow's foot notations doesn't point to the corresponding attributes. Please check out the E-R diagram from our lecture note for details or come to my office hour if you need help on understanding conceptual model and E-R diagram.

### DATABASE CREATION (DDL)

#### C. Database creation (CREATE TABLE commands) (max 10 points)
Excellent!

#### D. Data loading (INSERT TABLE commands) (max 5 points)
Excellent!


### DATABASE MANIPULATION (DML)

#### E: Correctly retrieving/displaying all information (max 10 points)
Excellent!

#### F: Correctly retrieving/displaying all information (max 10 points)
Excellent. It will be good that the output only has two columns: item_name and start_biding_price. This will make the final output easier to read. 

#### G: Correctly retrieving/displaying all information (max 10 points)
Excellent. 

#### H: Correctly retrieving/displaying all information (max 10 points)
Excellent.
